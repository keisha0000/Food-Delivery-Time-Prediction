# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction

##Overview

This project was developed as part of the Digica Academy Bootcamp (April - July 2024) and aims to predict food delivery times based on various factors like delivery person age, weather conditions, traffic density, and more. By accurately predicting delivery times, the goal is to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce uncertainty around order deliveries.

##Analysis and Modeling

The project involved the following key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting data types, and feature engineering.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the relationships between variables and their impact on delivery time.
3. Model Building: Developing predictive models using algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest, with hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search.
4. Evaluation: Measuring model performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

##Model Performance

The best model achieved an R-squared accuracy of 82%, meaning it explains 82% of the variance in delivery times based on the provided features. While this is a strong result, there remains 18% of unexplained variance, indicating room for further improvement.

##Key Insights

*Shorter delivery times correlate with a higher number of orders.
*Effective management of delivery times could lead to an increase in customer satisfaction and order volume.
